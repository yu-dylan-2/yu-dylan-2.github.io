Take a look at [PUMAC Geometry B 2015/1](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/570450471d07c094a39efaed/t/58b0d92a37c5814e3bc9b838/1487984940227/PUMaC2015_GeometryB.pdf) and [AIME II 2007/3](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2007_AIME_II_Problems/Problem_3). Can you find other examples of this?
