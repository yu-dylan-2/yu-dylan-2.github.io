Take a look at [PUMAC Geometry B 2015/1](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/570450471d07c094a39efaed/t/58b0d92a37c5814e3bc9b838/1487984940227/PUMaC2015_GeometryB.pdf) and [AIME II 2007/3](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2007_AIME_II_Problems/Problem_3). Can you find other examples of this?

Update 2021-01-17: [IOQM 2021/18](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h2419220) and [USAMTS 03/04/11](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h496010p2785243) (and apparently an old Chinese National HS ML question too, but I couldn't find that). In fact, the IOQM problem was posted today!
