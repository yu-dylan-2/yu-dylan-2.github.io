With AI, you can make systems that look like they have bad handwriting. Even Shakespeare:
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/bad=shakespeare.png" width="400px"></img></div>
What about some Extremal Graph Theory?
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/bad-graph.png" width="400px"></img></div>
And let's end with a definition from Euclid's Elements (translated, of course):
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/bad-euclid.png" width="400px"></img></div>
Did you notice the "I"s look like "5"s and the "T"s look like $\pi$s? Surprisingly, still better than my handwriting:
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/bad-handwriting.jpg" width="400px"></img></div>
(Ok, not actually, but close enough.)
